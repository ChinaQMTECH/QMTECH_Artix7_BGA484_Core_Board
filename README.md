The XC7A35T/XC7A50T/XC7A200T core boards are using the same pcb for manufacturing. 
So the hardware schematic in the hardware folder could be used for all these three FPGA core boards.
The hardware user manual and software user manual only describe the content based on XC7A200T FPGA. 
However, these two user manuals could also be applied for the XC7A35T and XC7A50T FPGA.
